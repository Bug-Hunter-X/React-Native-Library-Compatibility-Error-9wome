To solve this issue, you need to ensure that all libraries you are using are compatible with the version of React Native you are using. You can check this by looking at the library's documentation. If a library is not compatible, you will need to either find a different library or upgrade your React Native version. Another approach is to use a package manager such as npm or yarn. Ensure you carefully check your dependencies and address version conflicts.
