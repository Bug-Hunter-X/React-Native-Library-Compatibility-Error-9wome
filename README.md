# React Native Library Compatibility Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native development: library compatibility issues.  This often manifests as unexpected behavior or runtime errors during app execution. The error arises when different libraries in your project have conflicting dependencies or are not compatible with the current React Native version. 

## Bug Description
The application crashes or behaves erratically due to library incompatibility.  This could involve version mismatches, conflicting dependencies, or use of a library not yet supported by your React Native version.

## Bug Reproduction
The `bug.js` file contains a simplified representation of this problem. It involves including two incompatible libraries that, when used together, may result in an error such as:

* A runtime error or exception.
* Unexpected behavior within the app.
* Failure to build the application.

## Solution
The solution is detailed in `bugSolution.js`.  The key is ensuring that all libraries are compatible with the current React Native version and that there are no conflicts among the dependencies.  This often involves:

* Carefully reviewing the library documentation for compatibility information.
* Using a dependency management tool like npm or yarn to resolve version conflicts.
* Checking for newer versions of conflicting libraries that might have resolved compatibility problems.
* Using package.json's resolutions field to specify a version when using multiple conflicting packages.
